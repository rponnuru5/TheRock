  # TODO: rework "artifact_run_id" and "use_prebuilt_artifacts" here?
  #   I don't want to copy/paste this condition and special case plumbing
  #   through multiple workflows. All the packaging and testing workflows need
  #   to know is what artifact run id to use. That could be the current
  #   (implicit) run id, or it could be an explicit run id.
  #   How about having the "build artifacts" job run as a passthrough?
